### macrostate conformations

Four distinct protein macrostates were derived by this study. PDB files for each macrostate monomer and selectivity filter are provided here: `pdb/mono_{macrostate label}.pdb` and `pdb/sf_{macrostate_label}.pdb`. The `{macrostate label}` for each state is illustrated below.

### sequence alignment

Alignment of the CLC-2 model with the 3ORG template structure monomer and
selectivity filter are given in the `sequence_alignment` directory.
